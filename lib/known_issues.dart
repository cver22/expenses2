      //TODO KNOWN ISSUES
//TODO deleting of logs should also delete any of their entries, otherwise there is a loading error in entry ties
//TODO looping issue where saving a tag, rebuilds the log state in the back ground, what needs to happen is the log screen is not rebuilt because the selectedEntry is not empty
//TODO selected entry needs to be cleared when saving, but that caused a loop, need to utilize the isLoading state in entries state
//TODO going back from entry does not clear the logTags from the singleEntryState logTagList




      //TODO General
//TODO re-ordrerable list for categories - this may be solveable by creating category/subcategory state for manipulation and then eventually savings
//TODO edit tags
//TODO methods to do combined updating of states such as the entry and log state at the same time for some reason?
//TODO organize and filter entries in various ways
//TODO deleting a log deletes all of its entries, will be easier to implement when I start using a ledger for each year in a log
//TODO how to put an empty map in a JSON so the array doesn't initiate empty
      //TODO record of total log expenditure by month





    //TODO START HERE

//iterate over tags when category is added or changed
